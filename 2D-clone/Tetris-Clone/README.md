## Know Bug

This bug appears with the L and J block in the 4th column, this bug means that visually we believe  
that there is an invisible block when in fact it is one of the L or J blocks which is moved to the  
4th column but visually it is still where they should. be to adjust it you have to find it and put a block in this location
