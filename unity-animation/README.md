# Unity - Animation

## Background Context
Welcome to a project that will test your codebase and state machines to support real-time animations and animation blending. This project will not only enhance your understanding of how code architecture influences animation and other aspects of game development but also provide you with a deep dive into how 3D animation is created and modified inside of the Unity Editor.

Animation is the heart of character control and environmental interaction in games. It breathes life into your characters, making them move, react, and interact. It’s the illusion of life that brings your game world into existence. This project will guide you through the process of creating and controlling animations in Unity, from simple movements to complex sequences.

Upon completion of this project, you will have a solid understanding of Unity’s animation system, and you will be able to create and control a variety of animations for your game characters and environment.

Are you ready to bring your game to life?

## Technical Description
This project focuses on the following key areas:

* __Understanding Animation__: Learn the difference between 2D and 3D animation, and understand the parts of a 3D model and how they are animated.  

* __Unity Animation System__: Get to know Unity’s animation system, including Animation Clips and Animator Controllers. 

* __Animation Implementation__: Learn how to import and use Animation Clips, and how to control them with scripts.  

* __State Machines__: Understand the concept of a State Machine and a Sub-State Machine, and how they are used in animation control.  

* __Root Motion__: Learn about Root Motion and how it can be used to create more realistic movement in your animations.   

Please create a separate Unity project under the holbertonschool-unity repo, naming it  `unity-animation`.  

Note: Using free or paid script assets from the Unity Asset Store or elsewhere is prohibited for this project. Focus on creating your own scripts that interact with Unity’s character controller components.

The final product after the next few projects will function like this: Platformer - Final

At the end of this Animation project, we will be at this stage in development: Platformer WIP - Animation

Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
* What is a keyframe?  
* How is 2D Animation different from 3D animation?  
* What are Dopesheets and how do you use them?  
* What are Curves and how do you use them?  
* How to import and use Animation Clips?  
* What are Animator Controllers and how do you use them?  
* What is a State Machine?  
* What is a Sub-State Machine?  
* What is Root Motion?  
* How does animation enhance the player’s gaming experience?  
* How to create and control a variety of animations in Unity?  

## Requirements
### General
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Use Unity’s default .gitignore in your holbertonschool-unity directory
* Push the entire project folder unity-animation to your repo
* All scenes and project assets (such as Scenes, Scripts, Materials, etc.) must be organized as stated in the tasks
* Your scripts should include markup and notation to describe functionality, bugs, and help make the codebase easier to read and understand
* Free or paid assets are not permitted for this project. Focus on creating your own scripts that interact with Unity’s existing character controller components.
